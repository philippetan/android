    <h1>Privacy Policy for Pawfectly Adoptable</h1>

    <p>At Pawfectly Adoptable, we value the privacy of our users and are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application and related services. By using Pawfectly Adoptable, you agree to the practices outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We collect the following personal information to verify user identity and ensure the security of the adoption process:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name</li>
        <li>Email address</li>
        <li>Phone number</li>
        <li>Physical address</li>
        <li>Photos of valid IDs and certificates</li>
        <li>Information related to your role (Adopter or Shelter) and any details you choose to share in your profile (photo, location, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Non-Personal Information</h3>
    <p>Through Firebase, a service provided by Google, we automatically collect certain non-personal information to improve app performance and user experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device information (e.g., model, operating system)</li>
        <li>App usage data (e.g., session frequency and duration)</li>
        <li>Location data (e.g., approximate city or region, derived from IP address)</li>
        <li>Browser type and version (for web applications)</li>
        <li>Aggregate data (e.g., total downloads, average session time)</li>
        <li>Behavioral data (e.g., feature usage patterns)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purpose of Data Collection</h2>
    
    <h3>2.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>We collect personal information to verify user legitimacy, facilitate communication between users (for example, between adopters and rescue shelters), and ensure a safe environment for adopting animals.</p>

    <h3>2.2 Non-Personal Information</h3>
    <p>Firebase automatically collects non-personal data, which we use solely to analyze app performance, understand user behavior, and improve the overall experience for our users. Firebase’s data collection practices are governed by Google's Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    
    <h3>3.1 Storage Location</h3>
    <p>All data is stored on Firebase's Cloud Firestore, a secure cloud service provided by Google.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Data Retention</h3>
    <p>Data in Cloud Firestore is subject to the following retention policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Time-to-Live (TTL) Policies:</strong> We may set automatic expiration dates for certain documents to delete stale data within 24 hours after expiration.</li>
        <li><strong>Backups:</strong> Firestore supports scheduled backups with a retention period of up to 14 weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR):</strong> PITR retains all data versions for up to seven days, enabling restoration to any point within that window.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not currently share user data with third parties. We take reasonable measures to protect the information you provide from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. If this changes in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy and notify users in advance.</p>

    <h2>User Rights and Controls</h2>
    
    <h3>5.1 Access, Update, and Delete</h3>
    <p>Users have the right to access, update, or delete their personal information. They can do so directly through the app settings.</p>

    <h3>5.2 Opt-Out Options</h3>
    <p>Upon deletion, all associated information will be removed from our database, and the user will no longer have access to their account. However, certain information may be retained as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>

    <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>We use various tracking technologies to improve the app experience:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Small files stored on users’ devices to remember preferences and track activity over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Web Beacons:</strong> Images or scripts that track interactions with content (primarily in emails and web pages).</li>
        <li><strong>SDKs (Software Development Kits):</strong> Firebase SDKs allow us to track app usage patterns and events.</li>
        <li><strong>App Instance IDs and Analytics Tags:</strong> These are used to monitor user interactions and optimize app performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security Measures</h2>
    <p>We prioritize the security of your data and use Firebase’s security features to protect it. Key measures include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication Controls:</strong> Firebase's secure authentication processes prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Admin Access:</strong> Only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information, following strict access control policies.</li>
    </ul>
